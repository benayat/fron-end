react automatically goes to public directory by default:
- if you provide src for image html element - src='/logo.png', it will search it first in public folder.
- faceapi - could'nt load models at first, but when I understood how to load models: by using 
  the same method, relying on public and load with '/models', and I had to put models in the public directory.
