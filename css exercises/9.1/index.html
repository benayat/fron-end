<!-- answers:
1. the problem was that even though we used "position: absolute" for the inner class, it's position wasn't relative to the outer father class, and it was above it. instead, it was only relative to the whole page - the body.
2. to fix this code, I just made the father's position "fixed", so now the inner square is on the inner one, and is moving relatively to hit, and not to the body.
